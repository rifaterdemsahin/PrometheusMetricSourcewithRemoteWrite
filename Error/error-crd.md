error: resource mapping not found for name: "prometheus" namespace: "" from "prometheus.yml": no matches for kind "Prometheus" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
ensure CRDs are installed first

## Solution
To resolve this issue, make sure that the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Prometheus are installed. You can install the CRDs by running the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml
```

After installing the CRDs, try applying your configuration again.

If you encounter an error stating that the CustomResourceDefinition is invalid due to metadata annotations being too long, you can resolve this by manually editing the CRD file to reduce the size of the annotations or by using a different version of the CRD file that does not have this issue.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml
```

After making these adjustments, try applying your configuration again.

If you still encounter issues, ensure that you are using the correct API version for the CustomResourceDefinition. The following command uses the `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` API version, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.16+:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml
```

After ensuring the correct API version, try applying your configuration again.

If the issue persists, consider checking the Prometheus Operator documentation or seeking help from the community forums for further assistance.
